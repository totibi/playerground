/**
	* @author Alexander @date 23.09.19.
	*         RefSpec allows you to define tests as methods, which saves one function literal per test compared to style classes that represent tests as functions.
	*         Fewer function literals translates into faster compile times and fewer generated class files, which can help minimize build times.
	*         As a result, using Spec can be a good choice in large projects where build times are a concern as well as when generating large numbers of tests
	*         programatically via static code generators.
	*         Note: The "Ref" in RefSpec stands for reflection, which RefSpec uses to discover tests. As reflection is not availble in Scala.js, this class is not available on Scala.js.
